    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>an inside-out sushi, which is filled with nori sheet wrapping around the ingredients on the inside and the sushi rice is on the outside. Here, shrimp tempura and cucumber are tucked inside the nori, and thinly sliced avocado is layered on top of the roll, and when it’s sliced, the artistically arranged sushi resembles the scales of a dragon.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Japanese or Persian cucumbers (4 oz, 113 g)</li>
        <li12 avocados (12 oz, 340 g)<li>
        <li>4 sheets nori</li>
        <li>8 pieces shrimp tempura</li>
        <li>1 small cucumber, peeled, seeded, and cut into matchstick-size pieces</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp tobiko (flying fish roe)</li>
        <li>2 cups sushi or short grain rice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cut cucumber lengthwise into quarters. Remove the seeds and then cut in half lengthwise.</li>
        <li>Cut the avocado in half lengthwise around the seed and twist the two halves until they separate. Hack the knife edge into the pit. Hold the skin of the avocado with the other hand and twist in counter directions. The pit will come out smoothly.</li>
        <li>Remove the skin and slice the avocado widthwise.</li>
        <li>Gently press the avocado slices with your fingers and then keep pressing gently and evenly with the side of the knife until the length of avocado is about the length of sushi roll (length of nori seaweed). If you don't serve the sushi roll right away, I recommend squeezing lemon over the avocado to prevent discoloration.</li>
        <li>Wrap the bamboo mat with plastic wrap and place half of the nori sheet, shiny side down. Dip your hands in tezu (vinegar water) and spread ½ cup sushi rice over the nori sheet.</li>
        <li>Turn it over and put the shrimp tempura, cucumber strips, and tobiko at the bottom end of the nori sheet. If you like to put unagi, place inside here as well.
        </li>
    </ol>
